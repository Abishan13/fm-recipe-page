## My process

I started by laying out the semantic HTML structure. This involved organizing the content into appropriate sections, using tags like <header>,<body>, and <footer> to ensure a well-structured and accessible page. The semantic HTML not only helped in making the content more understandable but also improved the SEO and accessibility of the project.

After completing the HTML structure, I moved on to the CSS styling. This phase involved defining the visual aspects of the page, including layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness. I utilized modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid to create a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes. Additionally, I applied custom fonts, color schemes, and styling elements to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
