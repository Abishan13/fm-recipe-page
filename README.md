## My Process

1. **Planning and Structure:** I started by defining the semantic HTML structure, organizing the content into meaningful sections. This included using tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to create a clear and accessible layout.

2. **Styling and Design:** Once the HTML structure was in place, I focused on the CSS styling. I employed modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid to create a responsive design that works well on various devices. The design phase also involved choosing a color scheme, setting typography, and ensuring consistent spacing and alignment.

3. **Responsive Design:** Special attention was given to making the page responsive, ensuring that it provides a smooth user experience on both mobile and desktop devices. This involved media queries and flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** For a clear and accessible structure.
- **CSS:** Including modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid for layout.
